The weakest known space pirates to actually get involved with a boarding action.
They serve as meat shields and labour for the more powerful pirates

This fight is no joke. Standing in front of you is an assailant

far more powerful than you have encountered on any of his whelps before. 
His mere presence causes cold sweat to pour down your face and his voice

deal with such a fearsome foe."""
